# Vinox
Open source moddable sandbox game


Huge thanks to the following projects either due to resources provided or support when needed:
https://github.com/Dauthdaert/Box-World/tree/main
https://playspacefarer.com

One note is structures at the moment are not first class in support or will be in near future. At the moment itll basically be limited to a few generators that can take in a block type to be used. eventually i would like to support abritary structure placement but its not a priority.
